Hi, I’m Yechen Yu, a third-year undergraduate student in Information and Computing Science at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University of Technology.

My current research interests lie primarily in:

- Learning to Hash and its applications

- LLM Long Context Modeling

- Spatio-temporal Modeling

I am also open to **collaboration opportunities**—please feel free to reach out!

# 🔬 Research Skills

- **Research Experience**: Participated in the replication and improvement of deep learning models, as well as the deployment and fine-tuning of large language models, with experience connecting theoretical analysis to empirical validation.

- **Algorithm & Implementation**: Awarded a bronze medal at the ICPC 2024 Regionals. Implemented the full training pipeline for small-scale language models, from pre-training to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), enabling basic conversational capability.

- **Theoretical Analysis**: Conducted theoretical analysis within the Performer framework and explored derivations related to hashing methods, including Spectral Hashing, LSH, and ADSH.

- **English proficiency**: I have passed the CET-4 and CET-6 examinations. I possess experience in independently drafting academic papers and maintain a daily habit of reading scholarly literature.
